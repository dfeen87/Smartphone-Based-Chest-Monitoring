What You'll See
Once running, you'll get real-time data:
💨 Breathing Rate: 14.2 BPM
😴 Sleep Stage: LIGHT_SLEEP
📊 Confidence: 0.87 (87%)
🎯 Breath Cycles: 23
⚠️ Apnea: No issues detected

Testing It Works (Before Sleep)
Breathe normally while sitting:

Should show 12-20 BPM
Stage: AWAKE (high movement)

Hold your breath for 15 seconds:

BPM drops to near 0
Should flag "Possible Apnea" after 10 sec

Breathe deeply and slowly:

BPM drops (8-12)
Stage may switch to LIGHT_SLEEP

Move around:

Movement intensity increases
Stage switches to AWAKE

If all of these work → you're ready for sleep tracking!

Sleep Tracking Tips
Before Bed:

✅ Charge phone to 100%
✅ Enable Do Not Disturb
✅ Put phone in Airplane Mode (optional, saves battery)
✅ Secure phone in vest/band
✅ Start RespiroSync session
✅ Place phone on nightstand for easy access if needed

Positioning:

Phone should be snug but comfortable
If it moves around, accuracy drops
Vertical orientation is critical

Battery Life:

Expect 3-5% drain over 8 hours
Enable Low Power Mode for extra safety

Morning:

Stop session when you wake up
Review your sleep report
Export data if desired


Troubleshooting
"BPM shows 0.0 or crazy numbers"

❌ Phone not positioned correctly
✅ Ensure it's vertical on chest, not loose

"Stage always shows UNKNOWN"

❌ Not enough data yet (wait 2-3 minutes)
✅ Stay still, breathe normally

"Confidence is very low (<0.3)"

❌ Phone is moving too much
✅ Tighten your vest/band

"Battery drains fast (>10%/hour)"

❌ Other apps running in background
✅ Close all apps, enable Airplane Mode

"Gyroscope not available error"

❌ Your phone is too old (pre-2015)
❌ Sensors are disabled in settings
